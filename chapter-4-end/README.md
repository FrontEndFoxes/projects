# Chapter 4 - Create an Adoption Experience

> A Vue.js project to find pets

This is the fourth chapter of [workshops](https://workshops.vuevixens.org) run by Vue Vixens. If you get lost during the event or while working on your own, upload a copy of this code into CodeSandbox to keep progressing. Please note, the base structure of the project is different here, vs. in CodeSandbox, but the main files that you work with (App.vue, main.js) are in place.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
